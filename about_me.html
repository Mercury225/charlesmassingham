            <h2>Website Architect</h2>
            <p>
              A website architect is someone who builds websites and gives life
              to websites by communicating excellent design, as well as
              the organisation's values, brand-image and language. In the past i
              have spent time getting to know the people of an organisation, and
              manifesting their values through the use of art and design within
              practical considerations.
            </p>
            <h3>What got me into website development</h3>
            <p>
              I just recently started out in front-end development using HTML,
              CSS and Javascript to create my own websites and designs. I love
              discovering all the nuances that go into website creation, and
              admiring the final product once it's finished. The best part of
              this job is that something remains and is left for others to use
              and benefit from. So, i'm a website builder at heart. I hope to
              expand into more product-based tech like phone and gaming apps.
            </p>
            <h3>Something interesting about me</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a language enthusiast and linguist. I love to learn languages,
              so it goes well with learning computer languages which i have come
              to enjoy as a fun and simpler application from complex human
              languages.
            </p>
            <h3>Any nicknames?</h3>
            <p>
              Too many, including the many nicknames given to me in other
              languages. Charlie, Chaz, Chance, Mercury, Sandy, call me what you
              like!
